## Roadmap

v0.x:
- oopize everything that is most used

v1.x:
- PHP extension (using Zephir) to reduce memory footprint
- Class renaming and scope change:
    - `StringUtil` to become `XString` class
    - `ArrayUtil` to become `XArray` class
- `XString`: constructed with mbstring functionality
- `XArray`: maybe function overloading?
